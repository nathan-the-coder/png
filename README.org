*** Linux
**** Arch Linux
# feh -> it is used to view png file using `make view`

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
# You can change the image width and height using:
# ./bin/{Debug,Release}/make_png [width] [height]

# Ex: this will generate image with the width of '100' and height of '100'
./bin/Release/make_png 100 100
#+END_SRC
